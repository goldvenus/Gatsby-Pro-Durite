Polymers   are   used   for   countertops,   fixtures   and   other   manufacturing products  in  Acrylic,  Polyester, Epoxy  resin and  many  other  types  of  Polymers depending on the product.  Each type of polymer has it’s own advantages and disadvantages.  

Polyester  offers  clarity  and  beauty  that  we  see  in  many  man  made  materials today (normally sold in slab format). Polyester is not our desired polymer, it is very  volatile  (explosive  prior  to  curing  like  acetone)  and  high  fume  smell prior to curing requiring special control chambers, ventilation and masks.

Durite  R&D  is  constantly  evaluating  newly  advanced  polymers,  and  assess  in what type of environment, durability and maintenance it can be best used.

Countertops require stiffness (bridal) and rigidity so if used as cantilever, the material does not bend on its  own weight. Surface must be hard and resilient to allow all sorts of conditions like citric acid, lime juice, salts and other fluids that  can  eat  away  the  surface. Anti-Bacterial    surfaces  approved  by  the  (FDA Standards)  is  another  major  and  important  feature  when  coming  in  contact with food. Each surface must be engineered subject to its own environments.

Polymers allows continuous pour, castings, bonding etc.   the advancements of polymers  in  material  science  has  achieved  strength  and  properties  that  are incredible  and  impressive  (12  ksi  compression  &  2  ksi  tension  without  any reinforcement’s).  As an example, the new Stealth Fighter F-22 "Rapture" uses a form of polymer for its clear cockpit, resistant to shock waves and heat.

Polymers  allows  us  to  set  pieces  next  to  each  other  and  chemically  bond  it continuously,  making  joints  disappear  and  becoming  one  piece.  This  ability cannot be achieved with cement based materials.  It’s similar to metal welding,
