With  infinite  possibilities,  as  infinite  as  stones  and  their composition  like quartz, mica, shiest, silica, micro- marine shells, calcite, shells, fossils, obsidian (volcanic glass), we can create infinite surfaces.

Using  local  and  natural  materials  to  manufacture  is  our  strength  and  it  is  a cost   effective   approach   than   transporting   goods   from   one   continent   to another.

Depending  on  the  size  of a project,  and  location,  custom  materials  can  be created  to  fit  your  budget  and  achieve  the  esthetic  look  that  is  desired.  No project is too small or too large.   

Creating  unique  materials  is  our  goal.  After  the  control  sample  is  evaluated, production cost can be explored.

Nature guides us to create many materials that are  admired by many. We can engineer most of those materials to our specifications. The world of Polymers is  a  Pandoraâ€™s  Box  and  we  can  see  some  of  those  creations  in  smaller  scale, like eye wear glass frames, Tortoise Shell, Man made pearlite Piano Keys, and many other exotic polymer. Combined with natural materials like Pink Quartz, or  Fossils,  Amethyst,  Gold  Coated  Glass  (like  the  Deco  Period),  and  infinite other creation, nothing short of the wow factors.
