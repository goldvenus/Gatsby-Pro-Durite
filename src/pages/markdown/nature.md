title: FROM NATURE TO LAB - LET THERE BE STONE
path: "/nature"

Nature is creation, transformation, transition and evolution. The planet’s crust was  formed  from  within  and  from  elements  of  stars.  Forged  by  fire, gravity, magnetism, electricity, titanic plates, pressure, tension, torsion has all shaped and molded this planet through time.

For million of years stones are formed, telling us a story like a chapter from a book,  where  on  earth  the  stone  was  formed?  How it  was  formed?  What  can  it tell  us  about  the  depth  and  proximity  to  the  earth’s  mantel,  pressure,  heat, ocean,  desert,  and  forest  etc.  How  we  can  almost  replicate  those  processes  in lab and create  stones in colors we want, in  white and none-staining, in a very thin (1/8") without limitation to size, how we can reduce weight to a fraction, or engineer veining in any color, make it photo luminous, translucent or even transparent.  Lab-stones can be made opaque by day & transmit light by night.

<b class="accentText"><i>We  have  almost  reached  the  ultimate  and  we  can  recreate  almost  any  natural stone, better, harder, stronger and tailored.</i></b>

Liquid  polymers  formed,  forged  and  baked under  pressure  are  used  today  in many  highly  advanced  technologies  like  the  cockpit  of  the  new F-22  rapture stealth fighter plane.  Resisting shock waves, heat, pressure and friction.

Nature offers us many materials than we can use for fabrication. <b class="accentText">Quartzite</b> are stone  similar  to  sugar  grains  that  are  used  in  many  man-made  materials. Quartz is a hard stone, none staining, can come in clear or some natural colors. They  are  used  from  the  very  fine  sand  grains  to  large  pieces  embedded  in clear  resin  for  back  lighting  used  in  kitchen  and  bar  tops.    Crushed  Stones, Glass  Chips,  Shells,  are  graded,  washed  and  used  as  Terrazzo,  Agglomerate (Large  Stones  that  are  packed  closely  with  smaller  stones  in  between),  Or Conglomerate, mix of many different types of stones.

With  Quartz  we  can  produce <b class="accentText">"Concrete  Polymers"</b>  a  favorite  choice  of  many designers to look like concrete, but function without staining & cracking.

<b class="accentText">Terrazzo</b>  can  offer  us  infinite  possibilities  not  only  for  the  type  of  materials that we can use, but also size of stones, glass and shells from the very small to the very large sizes. We can engineer density, thickness, and weight.
