Nearly  every  HI-Rise  that  is  constructed  requires  endless  amount  of  kitchen countertops, vanity tops, and hotels mini-bar tops are an added feature.

In addition, it is becoming more and more a design practice to create bathtub surround,  shower  pans,  and  ADA  shower  pans,  trough  sinks  in  kitchen  and modern  sinks  in  bathrooms  and  many  other  features  that  lends  itself  to  the use of polymers and man-made materials.    

Most of this process begins at the design phase and lots of time and expense is dedicated  to  create  such  prototypes.  Especially  for  the  first  show  room  as  a model and example.  

Designers usually go to showrooms for ideas and inspiration. Durite is able to produce  almost  all    items  (respecting  Trade  Marks,  Copy  Rights  and  Patent Laws). We can manufacture 3D Precast , faster, better and more cost-effective.

With what you can bring to our table, we can partner with you. We are a single source  shop  and  have  the  ability  to  help  you  produce  and  provide  you  with support  in  the  event  you  may  need  immediate  adjustments  based  on  site conditions, and in some instances help you supervise/ install.   

You  may  want  to  provide  us  templates  because  it  would  be  impossible  to fabricate from drawings due to walls, or site geometry conditions.

Cabinet  makers  may  want  added  features  of  install,  by  inserting  plywood  to the underside of Tops that would help them drive screws into plywood rather than stone and make install very easy.

Plumbers  may  want  single  Trough  and  Shower  Pan  (factory  installed)  so  the trough  is  part  of  the  shower  basin.  Or  other  plumbing  fixture  request? Endless   abilities   and   combination   depending   on   how   you   would   want   it tailored? We certainly can make your work much easier and partner with you.
